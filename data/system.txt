The system is a 6-axis industrial robotic arm equipped with a vacuum suction gripper.

The robot is used to pick metal parts from a moving conveyor belt and place them into trays.

The perception system consists of an RGB camera mounted above the conveyor, along with fixed LED lighting.

The control system is based on ROS2 with a motion planning module and a grasp pose estimation module.

The robot operates in a factory environment where reflective metallic parts are frequently handled.

Human operators may stand near the robot to monitor the process and occasionally adjust parts manually.

An emergency stop (E-Stop) button is installed, but no physical safety fence is present.

The conveyor speed may vary depending on upstream production conditions.

The system is expected to operate continuously for long hours.

Environmental conditions include dust, vibration from nearby machines, and varying lighting conditions.

The task phases are:
1. Detect part on conveyor
2. Estimate grasp pose
3. Plan motion
4. Move to grasp position
5. Activate vacuum gripper
6. Lift part
7. Move to target tray
8. Release part

The success condition is that the part is safely placed into the tray without collision, drop, or damage.

Failure may result in dropped parts, collisions with equipment, or potential risk to nearby operators.
